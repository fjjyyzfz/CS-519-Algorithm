0. Unbouned knapsack:
   (a). By several loop, we can exhausted all solution, and find the best one. Time complexity O(2^n).
   (b). find the maximum value, and put it in bag. Then find the second largest value. Time complexity o(n).
   (c). (4,[(4,3),(1,2)])
   (d). top-down will be much faster.
   (e). bottom-up is much faster.
