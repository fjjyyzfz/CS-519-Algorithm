0. (a) First choose the smallest value in the list, then find the next smallest value in the following list.
    counter example: edcg
    (b) Find all topological sort takes O((V+E)*n)
1. Time complexity:O(VE)
   space complexity: O(E)
2. (a) 
    (b) they use dynamic programming
    (c) The best way to do topological sort is bottom-up.
