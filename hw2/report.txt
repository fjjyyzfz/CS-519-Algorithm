1. I spend 5 hours on this assignment.
2. Moderate.
3. I work it alone.
4. Sometimes I think I fully understand all materials, but when I were asked the question in different way, I failed. Maybe I am not fully understand all things, around 60%-70%.
5. It is hard to see from blackboard sometimes, even in record video, I can not see the blackboard. Maybe projection machine is a good way to see clearly.
